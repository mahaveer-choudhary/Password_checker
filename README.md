# Password Strength Checker

## Overview

This Python script provides a tool for evaluating the strength of passwords by analyzing their composition and estimating the time required to brute-force them. It assesses passwords based on length and character diversity, including numbers, lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and special characters. The script also provides feedback on the presence of special characters and categorizes the password strength into various levels.

## Features

- **Password Strength Assessment**: Evaluates passwords and categorizes their strength as "too weak," "weak," "good," or "strong" based on the character types included.
- **Special Character Analysis**: Identifies and counts special characters in the password, providing detailed feedback on their presence.
- **Brute-Force Time Estimation**: Estimates how long it would take to brute-force the password based on its length and character type diversity.
- **User-Friendly Output**: Provides clear, concise feedback on password strength, special character count, and estimated brute-force time.

## Functions

- `get_bruteforce_time(password_length, char_type)`: Returns the estimated time required to brute-force a password based on its length and character type.
- `determine_char_type(user_password)`: Determines the character type composition of the password and provides a strength assessment.
- `strength_checker(user_password)`: Checks the password for special characters, calculates its length, determines its strength, and estimates brute-force time.
- `main()`: The entry point of the script. Prompts the user for a password and displays the strength analysis and brute-force time estimation.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Run the script using Python 3.x.
3. Enter a password when prompted.
4. Review the feedback on password strength, special characters, and estimated brute-force time.

```bash
python password_strength_checker.py
